      <h3><b>SOUND AND SILENCE</b></h3>
      <p>|SOUND AND SILENCE| is a touring exhibition that will take place at three galleries across England and Europe in 2025. The exhibition brings together four artists and bell makers who explore the function and fabrication of bells in different ways. The exhibition will feature sonic sculptures, installations, performances, workshops and live bronze casting - shining a light on the history, making processes, contemporary position and sculptural nature of bells. Alongside the exhibition we will produce a radio documentary about the project.</p>
      <h5>Copper Sounds</h5> 
      <p>Copper Sounds are an artist duo who use traditional and contemporary processes to explore the physical and visual nature of sound. They see sound as a malleable material and have a unique way of working with and manipulating sound, through designing and making sonic objects which they play live. Recent work has focused on minimalist-inspired compositions, exploring the different acoustic and resonant properties of particular ceramic shapes and forms. This research culminated in ‘Sequenced Ceramics’, an immersive installation and performance piece in which large scale ceramic vessels are played by sequencer-triggered mechanical beaters, creating minimalist-inspired rhythmic compositions diffused across a multi-channel sound system. The piece was shown at The Michael Pennie Gallery, Bristol New Music festival 2022, The British Ceramics Biennial 2023 & the Indian Ceramics Triennial 2024.</p>
      <h5>Emma-Kate Matthews</h5> 
      <p>Emma-Kate is an architect, composer, musician, and digital artist whose work explores the creative intersections of sonic and spatial practices. She specialises in producing site-specific, spatialised audio-visual projects that investigate creative reciprocities between sonic and spatial practices. Her compositions have been performed at internationally renowned venues, including the Sagrada Familia, the Southbank Centre, the Barbican, and the Brighton Festival. Notably, she composed for the London Symphony Orchestra’s prestigious Panufnik residency. As a solo artist, Emma-Kate has released a series of electronic-classical works on acclaimed labels such as Algebra, NMC, Musicity Global, and Accidental. Her music has been broadcast internationally on prominent platforms like BBC Radio 3, Resonance FM, and Tokyo Radio. In addition to her compositional work, Emma-Kate designs and creates her own instruments, known as Resonant Bodies. These innovative instruments explore dynamic relationships between sound and space, crafted using advanced digital modeling and manufacturing techniques. This project was nominated for both the Lumen Prize and the Aesthetica Art Prize in 2022 and was showcased at the Works+Words biennale in Copenhagen that same year.</p>
      <h5>David Snoo Wilson</h5> 
      <p>David specialises in bell casting and is one of only a handful of bell-casters still active in this country.  He has bells in the Royal household of the Prince Of Wales, among other places. In 2014 Wilson received the Winston Churchill Travel Fellowship to research bell foundries in central Europe and he traveled around eastern Europe to explore ways in which the performance could be incorporated with the process of metal casting. Over the years he has received funding for his research and development into bells from Arts Council England, and the Queen Elizabeth Scholarship Trust. As an educator and technician Wilson has worked at the Royal College of Art, at the foundry. Internationally he has run courses and workshops across European universities sharing his knowledge of metal casting.</p>
      <h5>Marcus Vergette</h5> 
      <p>Marcus Vergette, musician, bell-maker, sculptor, was born on the banks of the Mississippi river in Southern Illinois. He grew up in the UK. Much of his recent work involves making large bells (up to 3 metres high) in bronze, - his Time and Tide Bells. These are hung in specific locations around the coast and rung by the action of the sea at high tide. The first was installed at Appledore, Devon, in 2009. Subsequent sites range from Trinity Buoy Wharf, on the Thames, to the Outer Hebrides. Marcus is an accomplished double bass player, active on the jazz scene, and he is a composer.His creativity is rooted in the duality of being both sculptor and musician, spurred on by his belief in the democratisation of Art.The installation of bells often takes place to specially composed music. His performances are art ‘events’ combining music, text, visual art and theatre, as in the Marsyas Suite (Leo Records), inspired by the painting by Titian. In Tintinnabulation (nonclassical records) sounds of several bells are collaged with field recordings from the coast and fragments of vocal and instrumental improvisation.</p>

      <h5>Make Southwest, Devon</h5> 
      <p><i>22 March – 14 June 2025</i></p>
      <p>This exhibition in MAKE Southwest's Jubilee Gallery and outdoor courtyard will show the history, making processes, contemporary position and sculptural nature of bells. It brings together 4 sculptors and bellmakers exploring the function and fabrication of bells - Marcus Vergette, sculptor, musician, and bellmaker; Copper Sounds, artist duo exploring 3D digital design and bronze casting; David Snoo Wilson, travelling founder and sculptor, and Emma-Kate Matthews, architect, composer, musician, and digital artist. The exhibition features sonic sculptures, installations, films, performances, workshops and live casting. It will examine and explain the history and impact, past, present and future, of bell making and bell ringing in an exhibition that will be informative, fun and accessible for all ages, and feature plenty of events and chances to make some noise!</p>

      <h3><b>|WORK FEATURING SOUND AND SILENCE|</b></h3>

      <h5>Perfect Cyan Bright Square by Emma-Kate Matthews</h5> 
      <p>Perfect cyan Bright Square presents a sonic amalgam of ‘bell-ish’ instruments designed and made by Emma-Kate, which she calls 'Resonant Bodies'. Each sound is recorded using binaural and ambisonic microphones, helping to create a range of perspectival shifts that oscillate between slow-evolving background drones and shimmering foreground details. The resultant sound is ‘music-ish’, playing with loose rhythmic, harmonic, and tonal logics that fall in and out of order.</p>

      <h5>Sequenced Ceramics by Copper Sounds</h5> 
      <p>A unique take on deconstructed club / ambient music, the intimate and immersive sounds on ‘Sequenced Ceramics’ were made using seven purpose-built ceramic vessels, played using a custom made sequencer and mechanical beaters. The album is released as a limited edition of 50 ceramic vessels, each one unique, and glazed with a download code. This ceramic is also an instrument, its shape based on one of the seven ceramics used on the album.</p>

      <h5>Tintinnabulation by Marcus Vergette</h5> 
      <p>At the centre of this release are Vergette’s Time and Tide bells: handmade instruments which create sound with the rising sea levels. One of the bells is ringing at any given time of day as the tide wraps around our coast, retreats and returns again. There are eight bells currently scattered across the UK’s coasts, each existing as a democratic artwork owned by the local community.</p>
